Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill,
 KG, OM, CH, TD, DL, FRS, RA (30 November 1874 â€“ 24 January 1965)
 was a British statesman who served as Prime Minister of the United 
Kingdom from 1940 to 1945, during the Second World War, and again from 
1951 to 1955. Best known for his wartime leadership as Prime Minister, 
Churchill was also a Sandhurst-educated soldier, a Boer War hero, a Nobel
 Prize-winning writer and historian, a prolific painter, and one of the 
longest-serving politicians in British history. Apart from two years between
 1922 and 1924, he was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1900 to 1964 and represented 
a total of five constituencies. Ideologically an economic liberal and imperialist,
 he was for most of his career a member of the Conservative Party, which he led from 
1940 to 1955. He was a member of the Liberal Party from 1904 to 1924.
